You are an expert Android engineer. Build a production-quality Android app in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose and Material 3.

APP NAME
- MoodPulse (placeholder name, can be changed)

CORE REQUIREMENTS (MUST MATCH EXACTLY)
1) Main screen shows multiple big emojis in a beautiful grid (6–12 emojis).
2) User saves mood by LONG PRESS (press-and-hold) on an emoji.
   - While holding: show a circular progress indicator around/over the emoji that fills.
   - Save triggers when hold completes (e.g., 800ms).
   - If user releases before completion, do NOT save.
   - Provide haptic feedback on successful save.
   - On save: show a subtle checkmark + “Saved” snackbar/toast-like feedback.
3) The user can set mood 3 times per day: Morning, Afternoon, Night.
   - Exactly 1 entry per slot per day.
   - Default selected slot depends on current local time:
       * 05:00–11:59 -> Morning
       * 12:00–17:59 -> Afternoon
       * 18:00–04:59 -> Night
   - If an entry already exists for the selected slot today, prevent saving and show a friendly message (“Already saved for Morning. View calendar or edit.”).
   - Allow “Edit” for the existing slot by overwriting (but only if user taps an explicit “Edit mode” toggle OR confirms in a dialog). Keep default behavior as “prevent duplicate”.
4) Calendar analysis screen:
   - Monthly calendar grid.
   - Each day cell can display up to 3 small colored dots (or tiny emoji) representing Morning/Afternoon/Night moods.
   - Tap a day to open a bottom sheet showing the 3 slots with the saved emojis and timestamps (or “Not set”).
   - Simple stats section above calendar: current streak, longest streak, weekly average mood score (optional).
   - Must work offline.
5) Navigation:
   - Bottom navigation with 2 tabs: Home, Calendar.
6) Data persistence:
   - Use Room database.
   - Store mood entries: date, slot, emoji id/string, color, createdAt timestamp.
   - Enforce unique constraint per (date, slot).
   - Provide DAO queries for:
     * insert/update entry
     * get entry for date+slot
     * get all entries for a month range
     * get last N days entries
     * compute streak (days where all 3 slots exist)
7) Architecture:
   - Use MVVM with clean separation: data (Room), domain (use cases), presentation (ViewModels, Compose UI).
   - Use Kotlin coroutines + Flow.
   - No external heavy frameworks; Hilt optional but preferred for DI. If you use Hilt, configure it fully.
8) UI/Design:
   - Modern, minimal, “beautiful”.
   - Emoji cards: rounded corners, soft shadows, subtle gradients/halos.
   - Smooth animations on press/hold completion.
   - Support dark mode.
   - Use Material 3 theming.
9) Quality:
   - Provide a complete working project structure (packages, files).
   - Ensure it compiles.
   - Include comments where needed.
   - Avoid placeholder “TODO” for core features.

EMOJI SET (DEFINE IN CODE)
- Provide a data class MoodOption(id, emoji, label, color).
- Include at least:
  Happy 🙂, Neutral 😐, Sad 😢, Angry 😡, Love 😍, Tired 😴, Excited 🤩, Calm 😌, Anxious 😰
- Map each to a stable color (store as ARGB Long or hex string).

SCORING (OPTIONAL BUT NICE)
- Map mood option to numeric score 1–5 for simple averages.
- Use this to compute weekly/monthly average on calendar screen.

EDIT MODE (DETAIL)
- By default, if user tries to save for a slot already set, show dialog:
  Title: “Already saved”
  Message: “You already saved your Morning mood. Do you want to replace it?”
  Buttons: Cancel / Replace
- If Replace -> overwrite that entry in Room.

HOME SCREEN DETAILS
- Top area: slot selector (3 pills).
- Under: emoji grid (2–3 columns depending on screen width).
- Each emoji card:
  - Shows emoji large (48–64sp).
  - On long press: start hold progress ring animation.
  - On completion: call ViewModel.saveMood(slot, option).
  - Disabled state if slot already saved and not in replace mode (or still allow but confirm).
- Also show small “Today” summary row: Morning/Afternoon/Night with small emoji or empty placeholders.

CALENDAR SCREEN DETAILS
- Month header with prev/next arrows.
- Calendar grid with weekday labels.
- Each day cell:
  - day number
  - 0–3 markers (dots or mini emojis) for slots.
  - highlight today.
- Tapping day opens bottom sheet:
  - Shows date
  - Shows 3 rows: Morning, Afternoon, Night
  - Each row shows emoji + time or “Not set”
  - Optional: allow quick replace from sheet (select emoji -> hold to save also acceptable)

DATA / ROOM DETAILS
- Use java.time.LocalDate and store as TEXT via TypeConverter.
- Slot enum stored as TEXT.
- createdAt stored as Long (epoch millis).
- Room entities:
  MoodEntryEntity
- Domain model:
  MoodEntry
- Mapper between entity and domain.

USE CASES
- SaveMoodUseCase(date, slot, moodOption)
- GetDayMoodsUseCase(date)
- GetMonthMoodsUseCase(yearMonth)
- ObserveTodayUseCase()
- ComputeStreakUseCase()

STREAK DEFINITION
- A “complete day” means all 3 slots have entries.
- Current streak: number of consecutive complete days ending today (or yesterday if today incomplete; choose one and document it; prefer ending at last complete day).
- Longest streak: max consecutive complete days.

DEPENDENCIES
- Compose BOM
- Room
- Coroutines
- (Optional) Hilt
- Material3
- java.time (core)
- Avoid external calendar libraries; implement calendar grid manually.

DELIVERABLE OUTPUT
Provide:
1) Project package structure
2) Full code for each file (MainActivity, navigation, theme, models, database, dao, repository, use cases, viewmodels, composables)
3) build.gradle (module) dependencies and plugins
4) Any required AndroidManifest changes
5) Clear instructions to run

IMPORTANT
- No pseudo-code. Output real Kotlin code.
- Make sure imports are correct.
- Compose UI must be functional.
- Room DB must be working.
- Flows must be collected properly with collectAsStateWithLifecycle (add lifecycle-runtime-compose dependency).

Start by proposing the folder structure, then output each file with its path header like:
--- app/src/main/java/.../FileName.kt ---
<code>

Then gradle files.

Do NOT ask me questions; make reasonable choices to complete the project.
